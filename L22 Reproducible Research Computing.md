# **Lesson 22: Reproducible Research Computing**
This lesson focuses on reproducible research computing.

### **Introductory Videos**
 * [Discussion of reproducible research for computing readings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25h5oeCzCk&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=AshleeN.FordVersypt)

    * This video is significantly longer than usual, as it is an in depth lesson conducted by students over readings, specifically [reading 10](RecommendedReading.md), and as such composes the majority of this lesson.
