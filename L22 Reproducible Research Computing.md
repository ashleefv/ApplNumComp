    * This video is significantly longer than usual, as it is an in depth lesson conducted by students over readings, specifically [Reading 10](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/RecommendedReading.md#reading-10), and as such composes the majority of this lesson. For some examples, check out [Dr. Ford Versypt's github repository](https://github.com/ashleefv)
