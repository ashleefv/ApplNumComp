# **Lesson 16: Further Eploration of GUIDE in MATLAB**

This lesson focuses on GUI examples within MATLAB, exploring the capabilities of GUIDE. We will take an existing MATLAB GUI available [here](https://bitbucket.org/ashleefv/checlassfa20/src/master/In%20Class%20Problem%20Activities/MATLAB/2D%20Heat%20Conduction.mlappinstall) that has been packaged as an app and will edit its code to make improvements.

## **Instructional Video**
* [Packaging and installing MATLAB apps](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/packaging-and-installing-matlab-apps-101563.html)
 
## **Reflection**
* Were you able to install and open the MATLAB GUI linked at the top of this lesson?
* What are some weaknesses of this GUI design?

## **Activity**
* Download and run the sample [2D Heat Conduction MATLAB app](https://bitbucket.org/ashleefv/checlassfa20/src/master/In%20Class%20Problem%20Activities/MATLAB/2D%20Heat%20Conduction.mlappinstall)
