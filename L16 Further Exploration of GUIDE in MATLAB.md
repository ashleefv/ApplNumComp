# **Lesson 16: Further Eploration of GUIDE in MATLAB**

This lesson focuses on GUI examples within MATLAB, exploring the capabilities of GUIDE.

## **Instructional Video**
 * [Packaging and installing MATLAB apps](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/packaging-and-installing-matlab-apps-101563.html)
 
## **Reflection**
* Were you able to install and open the MATLAB GUI?
* What are some weaknesses of this GUI design?

## **Pre-Lesson Activities**
  * Download and install [MATLAB app](https://bitbucket.org/ashleefv/checlassfa20/src/master/In%20Class%20Problem%20Activities/MATLAB/2D%20Heat%20Conduction.mlappinstall)

## **MATLAB GUIDE Walkthrough**
* Example of callback components
  * [Specific component callbacks](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/add-code-for-components-in-callbacks.html)
    * Add each component, demonstrate where its callbacks are within the code environment and how to modify them
* Example Walkthrough of editing pre-installed app
  * [Practice problem prompt](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/2DHeatConduction%20GUI%20In-Class%20Problem.pdf)
   * Edit the practice problem to improve the code, editing each callback as needed
* [Walkthrough code](/CHEclassFa20/In%20Class%20Problem%20Solutions/MATLAB/simpleGUIusingGUIDE.m)
 * This walkthrough should focus on editing the GUI, showing with each step how to navigate the assocaited code, where the callbacks go, and what to include with each callback. (the updated Handles)
