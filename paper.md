# Summary
An open access course on topics including but not limited to solving systems of differential equations, estimating parameters for models 
using regression, writing manuscripts and dissertations, and developing graphical user interfaces.
These modules could be used collectively for a similar course at another institution, could be used for independent study by an online learner, 
or could be adapted piecemeal for incorporation into chemical engineering courses that involve programming,
data analysis, or differential equations modeling. 
Dr. Ford Versypt offered the Applied Numerical Computing course in Fall 2020, which was delivered in a hybrid of in-person, online synchronous, and online asynchronous formats.
Duncan Mullins, a PhD student from Dr. Ford Versypt’s lab who took the course in Fall 2019, assisted in conversion of the course to its online, disseminatable version.
Mr. Mullins was supported financially by NSF CAREER and CACHE grant support.
Dr. Ford Versypt wrote an ASEE Conference Proceedings paper on the course and presented on the course at the ASEE Annual Conference in June 2019[@FordVersypt2019]. 
# Statement of Need
Many STEM programs offer an introductory computer programming course to undergraduate students. This type of course typically focuses on details of a specific software environment or language, functional programming in a procedural or object-oriented paradigm, 
and the use of conditional statements and loops with basic data structures. A variety of languages are taught in such introductory courses as STEM educators have debated which is the “best” programming language to teach university STEM students. 
Some undergraduate and graduate programs also include one or more courses on numerical methods, primarily aimed at teaching algorithms and error analysis techniques while surveying the appropriate methods to be used on categories of mathematical problems. 
Exposure to numerical methods is highly dependent on the university and the discipline. Both the introductory programming and numerical methods courses clearly have their place in STEM fields; however, student training in these areas varies widely. 
This causes challenges for undergraduate and graduate students interested in research and industrial projects involving mathematical modeling using computational tools.

An upper division elective course for seniors and graduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields has been developed at Oklahoma State University (OSU) to build computational skills for mathematical modeling. 
The course was designed to fill a gap in the practical training of students engaged in computational research or industrially relevant projects across various STEM disciplines who have inconsistent previous experiences in computer programming and numerical methods. 
By accelerating the training time to develop competency in implementing modern best practices, students are enabled to be productive at using computational tools for research early in their graduate studies,
ideally allowing them to satisfy time-sensitive demands for generating results as soon as possible. Undergraduate students also benefit from learning practical computational skills that they can transfer into other courses and future projects in industry or other career paths. 
The practical training is achieved by covering modern software tools for mathematical modeling in science and engineering and for reproducible research computing via an active, hands-on approach supplemented by reading materials. 
Rather than covering just the basics of programming or detailed algorithms for numerical methods, the course is geared towards implementing modern tools for solving realistic continuum scale science and engineering problems, 
managing open source code projects, and disseminating computational research results through scientific documentation and publications. The course was developed and is taught by Dr. Ashlee N. Ford Versypt,
a chemical engineering faculty member with research expertise in applied mathematics and computational science and engineering. 
MATLAB and Python are taught side-by-side throughout the course, primarily using case studies from chemical engineering applications for problem-based learning exercises. 
These software environments were chosen due to the high rates of adoption in engineering fields and the extensive libraries of solvers for scientific computing and visualization tools available.
With competency in both of these software environments, students could extend their skills into other programming languages such as C, Java, or FORTRAN as needed. 
Additional software tools including Git for version control and LaTeX for scientific communication are covered in the course. 
The course has been taught four times since 2016 to a total of 74 OSU students across 11 STEM disciplines.
