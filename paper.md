# Summary
ApplNumComp is a repository of open educational resources supporting an introductory course on Applied Numerical Computing. Topics include Git for version control, LaTeX for typesetting, reproducible research computing, and MATLAB and Python for high-level programming and scientific computing applications of solving systems of differential equations, estimating parameters for models using regression, creating publication quality figures, and developing graphical user interfaces. The lessons can be used collectively for a similar course at another institution, for independent study by an online learner, for incorporation of individual lessons into other courses that involve related topics. 
 
# Statement of Need
An introductory course on Applied Numerical Computing was developed for senior undergraduate and graduate students interested in research and industrial projects involving mathematical modeling using computational tools. The class was designed to fill a gap distinct from introductory programming and numerical methods courses and was intended to be very practical. Graduate students new to computational research were the primary student group targeted for the course topics. We have previously detailed the course [@FordVersypt2019] and the final course project [@Ruggiero2018].

No single textbook covers all of the topics in the Applied Numerical Computing course. As the course emphasized best practices for reproducible research computing, we sought to apply the concept to the course materials for a reproducible computing educational experience. Here, we have curated a set of open educational resources for others to engage with the course lessons outside of the institution's learning management system and outside of the formal course. The main repository is organized into a set of lessons that include videos, activities, related references, and other instructional materials.  
 
# Author Contributions
Ashlee N. Ford Versypt developed the Applied Numerical Computing course at Oklahoma State University and taught it annually 2016-2020. The materials presented here were developed and delivered in a hybrid of in-person, online synchronous, and online asynchronous formats in Fall 2020. Duncan H. Mullins, a PhD student from Dr. Ford Versyptâ€™s lab who took the course in Fall 2019, served as a teaching assistant for the course and aided in conversion of the course to this online open access version.
