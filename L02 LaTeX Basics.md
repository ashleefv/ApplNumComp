# **Lesson 2: LaTeX Basics**

This lesson focuses on LaTeX for typesetting.

## **Introductory Videos**
 * [LaTeX basics, figures, and math usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE4oedooUM&feature=emb_title)

### **Comprehension Check**
* What did you find the most interesting or surprising from the videos?
* What was the most unclear or most confusing point in the videos?
* Do you have a big report for class, article for research, thesis, or dissertation to write either this semester or within the next few years in your degree program? 

## **LaTeX Download and Installation**
To run LaTeX on a computer, you need to install both the LaTeX implementation (MikTeX or MacTeX) AND an editor. 
Some editors come with the implementation, but TeXMaker is preferred because of its layout and formatting.

* [overleaf.com](overleaf.com) is an online editor option that also exists (sort of like Google Docs for LaTeX). 
  However, it is preferred to install LaTeX on your own computer.

  1. Install MikTeX
    * [MikTex download](https://miktex.org/download) Select the tab for your operating system and follow the step by step tutorial if 
     you want more guidance. Note: during the installation there should be an option to 
     "set Install missing packages on the fly". Selecting "Yes" is helpful.
    * If you are a Mac user and this does not work well for you, [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) is another alternative
  2. Install TexMaker
    * [TexMaker download](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html) click on the appropriate download link for your       operating system.
      After it has downloaded run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions.
      
      

## **Helpful Links and References**
  * [Details on how to use TeXMaker, especially how to compile the documents](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/doc.html)
  * [Nice reference or for more background on LaTeX](http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf)
  
  
## **Try This Activity**
* [Coding activity](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/LaTeX%20basics%20activity.pdf)
  
### Activity
* Partner up, one person is the coder (actually doing the coding), the other is the navigator (watches the screen, reads values from the assignment, gives suggestions, and proofreads)
* Discuss
* Switch roles, stay with the same partner, try part 2 of the activity
* Discuss
