# **Lesson 1: Git for Version Control**

This lesson focuses on Git for version control.

Note: the instructions are provided for using Bitbucket as the site for hosting version control repositories. Alternatively, GitHub may be used instead.

#### **Comprehension Check**
  * Do you have any experiences like that pictured in the ["Final".doc](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531) cartoon? If so, briefly describe one of your experiences. If not, why might an experience like this be challenging?
  * Did you encounter any challenges or errors in the Setting Up Version Control Software section?
### **Motivation for Version Control**

### **Git and Bitbucket Setup**
Create an account on bitbucket.org with individual university email. 

[Download and install Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git). Note the instructions include how to configure your username and email address AND how to automatically save your password (credential helper). These are often overlooked but are really helpful. 

Create two empty folders on the computer that are completely dedicated to tracking personal computational assignments and synchronous class activities. Do not put other class files or personal files in these folders. Also, do not put one of these folders inside the other.

* Folder 1: name it FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp (change firstname and lastname to own name) [ApplNumComp is a shortened reference to our course name]
Students will control everything in this folder and submit their homework through this folder.

* Folder 2: name it CHEclassFa20 [this folder is how to share coursenotes, examples, problems, etc.]
In class activity files are shared in this folder. Course instructor controls this shared folder.  

Create a Bitbucket repository. It is recommended to name it the same as the first folder created on the local device. In general, these names do not have to match, but it is really helpful when you are getting started or if you anticipate have several version controlled folders.

Link these repositories to Bitbucket

### **Try This Activity**

**Demo with Class folder

#### Activity
  In personal bitbucket.org account created with personal email account, go to the repository named FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp (change firstname and lastname to own name, and ApplNumComp to own version of shortened course name). This should have been created previously.
  Setup the repository to have a local directory on personal computer and connect the local directory to the online repository.  
    
  Create a new subfolder called Practice.
  Add any document or image file (preferably a small file) to the Practice folder.
  Get this file into your FirstnameLastnameApplNumComp repository on bitbucket
