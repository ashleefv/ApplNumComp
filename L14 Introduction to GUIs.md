## **Reflection**
* Based on your understanding of the video, what are examples of common graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that you use on a regular basis for non-scientific applications?

## **Introduction to GUIs**
* There are multiple [ways to build GUIs or Apps in MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/ways-to-build-matlab-guis.html)
* Follow this tutorial that demonstrate capabilities of GUIs in MATLAB using App Designer
  * [Example using MATLAB App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/create-a-simple-app-or-gui-using-app-designer.html)
  * App Designer is newer and recommended by MATLAB. It has more functionality but requires higher user familiarity with object-oriented programming
* Later lessons in this course will go further in-depth
