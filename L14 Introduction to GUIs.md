## **Reflection**
* Based on your understanding of the video, what are examples of common graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that you use on a regular basis for non-scientific applications?

## **Introduction to GUIs**
* Follow these tutorials that demonstrate capabilities of GUIs in MATLAB. Later lessons in this course will go further in-depth.
  * [Example using MATLAB App Designer](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/create-a-simple-app-or-gui-using-app-designer.html)
    * App Designer is newer and recommended by MATLAB. It has more functionality, but requires higher user familiarity with object-oriented programming
