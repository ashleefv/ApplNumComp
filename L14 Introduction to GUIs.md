# **Lesson 14: Introduction to GUIs and GUIs in MATLAB**
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are everywhere in the digital world. 
This lesson introduces this topic and an overview of the MATLAB functionality in creating them.

### **Introductory videos**
 * [Introduction to graphical user interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIGSJshYb90&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=CrashCourse)

#### **Comprehension Check**
 * Based on your understanding of the video, what are examples of common graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that you use on a regular   basis for non-scientific applications?
### **Introduction to GUIs**
* Examples of GUIs in everyday life- student examples can be very good, ask them all to provide an example of a GUI they interact with regularly
* Use of each of the following websites to demonstrate functionality; includes 2 walkghrough examples from Mathworks
* Follow through these walkthroughs, demonstrating capabilities of GUIs- more explanatory than in-depth, as later lessons go further in-depth
  * [Examples of MATLAB app designer](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/ways-to-build-matlab-guis.html)
    * Newer App designer for specifying Apps, more functionality with a little more user skill requirements
  * [Example of MATLAB GUIDE](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/about-the-simple-guide-gui-example.html)
    * Original MATLAB GUI developer environment.
  * [Overview of MATLAB GUIDE callbacks](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/add-code-for-components-in-callbacks.html)
    * More in-depth review of GUIDE and the callbacks which it has internally available
