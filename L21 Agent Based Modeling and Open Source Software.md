 * NOTE: This is an audio recording of a pre-COVID synchronous class session, as such the audio may be a bit spotty, use of autocaptions is recommended.
#### **Comprehension Check**
 * None for this lesson
### **Agent Based Models**
* [Case study](https://github.com/ashleefv/BeeNestABM)
* Consider ABM and explain what agent-based models are, some of their uses and powers
* Allow for tracking of unique items in simulation, allowing statistical analytics to be performed
* [Introduction to ABM](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/Intro%20to%20ABM.pdf)
* ABM [Bee Example](https://github.com/ashleefv/BeeNestABM)
  * [AIChE Bee Presentation](https://github.com/ashleefv/ApplNumComp/blob/master/AIChE%20Bee%20pres%20ANFV.pdf)
    * Powerpoint that explains in further depth development and uses of the case study simulation
